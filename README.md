# Bank Marketing Data Set 
The selected dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#) is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
