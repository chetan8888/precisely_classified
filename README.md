# Bank Marketing Data Set 
The selected dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#) is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

## Objective
This project will enable the bank to develop a more granular understanding of its customer base, predict customers' response to its telemarketing campaign and establish a target customer profile for future marketing plans.

By analyzing customer features, such as demographics and transaction history, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviours and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits. The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers. This will not only allow the bank to secure deposits more effectively but also increase customer satisfaction by reducing undesirable advertisements for certain customers.
